# Maintaining ScummWEB

## Local development

Use [the README quickstart](../README.md#run-locally) for a local server that
does not require Infisical. The managed `pnpm run dev --port auto` launcher
uses the ScummWeb Development vault for the Sentry smoke test. The same vault
supplies the development token for `pnpm run sentry:issues`. The issues
launcher ignores private local Sentry env-file overrides.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm lint` | Check JavaScript and JSX syntax. |
| `pnpm test` | Run the Node test suite. |
| `pnpm build` | Stage shell assets and build for production. |
| `pnpm run start --port auto` | Stage shell assets and serve the production build. |
| `pnpm run verify` | Build, serve, and boot detected targets using a local Chrome or Chromium installation. |
| `pnpm run record:preview` | Stream distinct preview frames as a local MPEG-TS feed. |

The app validates and stages the tracked [ScummVM shell](../scummvm-shell/)
into `public/` before development, build, and start. Make changes to the
browser shell in [`web-shell/`](../web-shell/) and rebuild the managed bundle.
Keep the runtime and its `data/plugins/` directory from the same build. Catalog
launches select an engine by target. Local launches detect the game from its files.

Production serves game data directly from `SCUMMVM_GAMES_ORIGIN`. Local
verification can use `/games-proxy/*`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` controls
metadata URLs, the sitemap, and robots. The sitemap includes the homepage and
catalog game pages. Player routes and the standalone emulator are excluded
from indexing.

Local builds skip Sentry source-map uploads. Hosted Vercel builds handle
uploads. Runtime capture uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_DSN`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENABLED`, and the project settings in
[`next.config.js`](../next.config.js).

See [Production delivery](production-delivery.md) for deployments, secret
rotation, and manual game publishing. The sibling AgentSCUMM repository owns
agent gameplay experiments.

## Rebuilding and upgrading ScummVM

`pnpm run build:scummvm` checks out the pinned release into
`vendor/scummvm-<tag>/`, applies the ScummWEB patches, builds WebAssembly and
its engine plugins, and syncs the deployable bundle from `dist/` into
`scummvm-shell/`. The build checks that it produced a plugin for every enabled
engine before syncing the bundle.

1. Update the release tag, its upstream commit, and the matching Emscripten
   SDK in [`scripts/scummvm-version.sh`](../scripts/scummvm-version.sh).
2. Run `pnpm run build:scummvm --prepare-source`. It verifies the checkout
   against the pin and applies [`patches/scummvm/`](../patches/scummvm/) in filename
   order. If a patch fails, port its change against the new upstream source
   and refresh the diff with `git diff HEAD -- <path>` from the vendor checkout.
   A fully patched checkout can be reused. Keep personal edits outside it.
3. Maintain the browser UI and filesystem in [`web-shell/`](../web-shell/).
   The build stages those templates with the asset version and game bucket
   origin. They own BrowserFS save compatibility, the remote filesystem,
   and the app's boot and input integration. The native filesystem patch
   lets ScummVM see those mounts through its POSIX backend. The shell also
   adapts BrowserFS operations and error codes to Emscripten 4.
4. Run `SCUMMVM_REUSE_CATALOG=1 pnpm run build:scummvm` to rebuild with the
   existing catalog. If the SDK changes the generated SDL audio glue, port
   [`scripts/patch_scummvm_audio.py`](../scripts/patch_scummvm_audio.py) and rebuild.
   The audio patch must succeed before the tracked bundle is replaced.
5. Run `pnpm test` and launch a catalog game and a local ZIP in Brave.
   Check the first frame, audio, save and resume, and that the selected
   engine is the only engine plugin downloaded.

The regular play route downloads `<gameId>.zip` directly from the public game
bucket, then unpacks it using the same code as a dropped ZIP. It mounts the
files under the configured catalog path so target names and saves carry across.
Hosted standalone URLs such as `/scummvm.html#sky` forward to the ZIP-backed
play page. The verification harness opens the same play page and reads its
embedded canvas. The native build still uses an HTTP index for its local
catalog detection step and generates an index for deployed engine data.

## Game launch analytics

On `scummweb.tsilva.eu`, GA4 tracks the following events for catalog games,
at most once per play page visit for each event.

| Event | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `game_launch_attempt` | The play page starts preparing the game, including looking for a browser save when Continue was requested. |
| `game_launch` | ScummVM confirms the first rendered game frame. `load_time_ms` measures time since the attempt began. |
| `game_launch_failed` | The player observes a startup error or ScummVM reports a first-frame timeout before success. `failure_reason` is `startup_error` or `first_frame_timeout`. |
| `game_play_milestone` | The ready player accumulates five minutes in the visible tab with the game controls available. `play_time_seconds` is `300`. |

The events share `game_slug`, `entry_point` (`hero`, `library`, `game_detail`, or
`direct`), and `launch_mode` (`fresh` or requested `continue`). Intro skips stay
within the same visit. The play timer pauses while the game reloads or the tab
is hidden. A visit can report a failure and later recover. Leaving before
the player reports an outcome appears as a drop-off in the funnel.
Local files, direct ZIP links, and previously saved external bucket launches
are outside this catalog funnel. Direct play links use the `zip` parameter in
the `/local/play` URL fragment, so the server never receives the ZIP address
as part of the page request. Google Analytics and Vercel Analytics page
locations omit that fragment. The client downloads the archive directly with
credentials omitted.

The catalog player downloads and unpacks the game ZIP before starting
WebAssembly. ZIP launches fetch only the engine data index.
To diagnose a launch locally, inspect the iframe's User Timing marks in the
browser's Performance panel. `scummweb:wasm-ready` marks the start of filesystem
setup, `scummweb:index:games` and `scummweb:index:data` mark completion of each
index fetch, and `scummweb:filesystems-ready` marks when ScummVM can start.
`scummweb:first-game-frame` marks the first detected rendered frame for catalog
launches. These marks use the iframe's navigation as their time origin.

In GA4 Explorations, build a closed funnel from `game_launch_attempt` to
`game_launch` to `game_play_milestone` to compare users at each step. For
counts by play page visit, report **Event count** by event name. Use
**Page path** to focus on a game and **Session source / medium** to break down
acquisition. Analyze `game_launch_failed` separately. To report on the custom fields, register
`game_slug`, `entry_point`, `launch_mode`, and `failure_reason` as event-scoped
custom dimensions and `load_time_ms` as a custom metric.

## Branding

The README uses the Adventure Terminal [logo](../logo.png). The original
ImageGen artwork lives in [`image-assets/sources/`](../image-assets/sources/).
The [provenance record](../image-assets/provenance.json) records source and
export hashes, and the [web asset manifest](../public/brand/manifest.json)
lists the exports and their dimensions.

The homepage serves the Adventure Terminal social card at `/opengraph-image`.
Game pages use their individual social cards. The shell finalizer copies the
browser and install icons from [`public/brand/web-seo/`](../public/brand/web-seo/)
into the managed shell during ScummVM rebuilds.

## Catalog fixtures and artwork

- The playable baseline is Beneath a Steel Sky from `downloads/bass-cd-1.2.zip`,
  launched through `/scummvm.html#sky`.
- To include The Secret of Monkey Island (Demo) in a catalog rebuild, place the
  [English DOS EGA demo ZIP](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/demos/scumm/monkey1-dos-ega-demo-en.zip)
  in `downloads/` as `monkey1-dos-ega-demo-en.zip`.
- Catalog hero banners live in [`scummvm-shell/launcher/`](../scummvm-shell/launcher/).
  The banners use ImageGen-restored promotional art. Screenshot galleries retain
  the original captures.
- The Secret of Monkey Island (Demo) uses
  [Steve Purcell's DOS box art](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/139-the-secret-of-monkey-island)
  and [DOS EGA demo screenshots](https://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/the-secret-of-monkey-island).
- Sfinx ZIPs use the CGE2 engine. Artwork comes from the
  [original box front scan](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/86024-sfinx)
  and [ScummVM gameplay captures](https://www.scummvm.org/screenshots/lkavalon/).
- Imported Indiana Jones games use the SCUMM engine. The importer recognizes
  the full titles in ZIP and folder names and shares art across platform,
  language, and edition labels in parentheses. Their posters come from the
  [Fate of Atlantis DOS box scan](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/5386-indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis)
  and [Last Crusade Amiga box scan](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/18310-indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-the-graphic-adventure).
  Gameplay images come from the [ScummVM screenshot gallery](https://www.scummvm.org/screenshots/lucasarts/indy/).
  The web build includes checksum-pinned [Xiph FLAC](https://www.xiph.org/downloads/)
  for CD speech archives such as Fate of Atlantis’s `monster.sof`.
- These personal SCUMM imports share one set of artwork across editions:

  | Game | Box scan | Gameplay capture |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Day of the Tentacle | [DOS cover](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/3575-maniac-mansion-day-of-the-tentacle) | [English DOS](https://www.scummvm.org/data/screenshots/scumm/tentacle/tentacle_dos_en_1_2_full.png) |
  | Loom | [Original cover](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/5391-loom) | [English DOS VGA](https://www.scummvm.org/data/screenshots/scumm/loom/loom_dos_en_2_2_full.png) |
  | Maniac Mansion | [Amiga cover](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/41172-maniac-mansion) | [English Amiga](https://www.scummvm.org/screenshots/lucasarts/maniac/) |
  | Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge | [Original cover](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/723-monkey-island-2-lechucks-revenge) | [English DOS](https://www.scummvm.org/data/screenshots/scumm/monkey2/monkey2_dos_en_1_1_full.png) |
  | Sam & Max Hit the Road | [DOS cover](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/58-sam-max-hit-the-road) | [English DOS](https://www.scummvm.org/data/screenshots/scumm/samnmax/samnmax_dos_en_1_3_full.png) |
  | Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders | [Amiga cover](https://openretro.org/amiga/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders) | [English Amiga](https://www.scummvm.org/screenshots/lucasarts/scumm:zak/) |

  The larger personal collection uses the per-title artwork and source links in
  [`app/retro-game-artwork.json`](../app/retro-game-artwork.json). It includes
  original box scans, gameplay captures, and title cards where a cover was
  unavailable. Different editions can point to the same files.
  The homepage uses a game's landscape artwork or gameplay capture as its
  slideshow backdrop. Imported slides use the same Play and reconnect actions
  as their library cards.

  Every recognized title in the asset pack must include a game-specific
  `summary`, `studio`, and `genre`. Keep metadata references in
  `sources.metadata` and describe unresolved credits in `metadataNote`.
  Slideshow heroes and library-card tooltips read the same record, including
  entries imported before a metadata update. Keep the library grid limited to
  cover cards and titles; show detailed metadata in the slideshow heroes.
  ScummVM's developer pages provide the
  primary references; genre labels and summaries are editorial descriptions.
  The fan game Road has an unverified creator credit and a description based
  on its locally verified gameplay.
